# x86_64-asm-tgbot
Attempting to build an x86_64 assembly telegram bot with a bit of C

### What the hell is going on?
Just 4fun Telegram Bot. I'll write most of the things in *assembly*, other, if needed, in C (C11).

### OK, then what?
Easy, just assemble it running make (Makefile provided).

### Why GCC?
It is easier to manage dynamically linked libraries. 

#### Linker entry point
*Linker entry point*: **main**
